People like new word. The term "cloud computing" is everywhere. I am not sure whether it is the time to replace it with a fancier word, just in order to keep peopleâ€™s warmth.

Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. 

For it to be considered "cloud computing," you need to access your data or your programs over the Internet, or at the very least, have that data synced with other information over the Web. In a big business, you may know all there is to know about what's on the other side of the connection; as an individual user, you may never have any idea what kind of massive data processing is happening on the other end. **The end result is the same: with an online connection (you can see it?)**, cloud computing can be done anywhere, anytime.
