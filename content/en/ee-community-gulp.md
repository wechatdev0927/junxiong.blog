[EarthEngine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/)  is a web-based IDE for the Earth Engine JavaScript API.  It provides a variety of fantastic features including: 

1. Generated map tiles for instantaneous display (which is the WOO HOO feature of EE)
1. Query objects placed on the map with the Inspector tab. 
1. [Display and chart numeric results](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/charts.html) using the Google Visualization API. 
1. Share a unique URL to your script with collaborators with the Get Link button. 

The bottleneck is that it is a pain to build big script with Javascript API because you have to copy all the functions into a single javascript file. Code Editor is a IDE which is designed for quick-test and prototype-development, not a IDE to maintenance a function of list, beautify/reformat the code, manage a lot of snippets (it based on googlesource, which will become very slow if you have a lot of snippets in a repo). But, if you move to Python API, hoping to enhance these aspects while coding, you have to sacrifice the above good things.

So for a long term I am seeking for a way which can help me organize my function and snippets in a manageable way:
[ee-community-gulp](https://github.com/gee-community/ee-community-gulp)

It can enable you to define some including files, which means you can put you common functions/code into single files, and include them into your main program when needed.  For example, I put all my function to operation ee.Image and ee.ImageCollection into file named eec.image.js. And in it there is a function named eec.image.sentinel2, which can generate sentinel-2 ImageCollection every 16-day (it will be useful if you want to do some time series analysis and it contain some simple cloud remove code).

Now I want to re-use eec.image.sentinel2 in another file,  ex1.js,  so I just need to include the file in the beginning, like:

```javascript
//=require ../eec.image.js 
var collect = eec.image.sentinel2('2016-6-1’, '2016-7-1’)
```

After the require statement I can call the function by name.

In order to use it, you have to clone the [repo](https://github.com/gee-community/ee-community-gulp) from github and following the installation guide. You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as dependency.
If you work under Linux and Mac OS X then you can make some shortcut with [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) and [pbcopy](http://osxdaily.com/2007/03/05/manipulating-the-clipboard-from-the-command-line/). If not you can still use it with some extra simple operations.

You are welcome to let me know which function you will like to contain in the including files.
